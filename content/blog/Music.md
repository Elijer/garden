> Music Theory and Reflecting on the different ways to learn guitar

While at the [[What is it? |Recurse Center]], a dapper individual wearing a ginko-print blazer (although they later confided that it was a pajama top) asked me whether I'd been playing guitar in the music room, and I had! So we played some guitar together and I found they were fluent in music theory as a guitarist.

Manuel recommended this artist while they were playing this little nice pattern:

They also recommends [Eric Haugen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoxdIEOrloeN00-3KWR4ZnQ) as a resource for getting better at guitar.

My roomate played this song and no tabs exist for it, so I have been trying to learn it:
