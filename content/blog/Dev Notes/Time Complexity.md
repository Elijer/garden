- **O(1)**: Constant time. The running time does not change with the input size.
- **O(log n)**: Logarithmic time. The running time grows logarithmically with the input size.
- **O(n)**: Linear time. The running time grows linearly with the input size.
- **O(n log n)**: Linearithmic time. The running time grows linearly times the logarithm of the input size.
- **O(n^2)**: Quadratic time. The running time grows quadratically with the input size.
- **O(2^n)**: Exponential time. The running time grows exponentially with the input size.
- **O(n!)**: Factorial time. The running time grows factorially with the input size.
