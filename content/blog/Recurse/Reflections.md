# Remote Becoming Reality
It's really a strange dreamlike experience to have seen many faces voices and tidbits of stories online, and before any sort of in person experience and then to end up arriving in a physical space. Of course this is also mirrored by moving to New York and experiencing this city in a sort of parallel way, where I was introduced to it and yet now, strangely, it's my home

# The Wisdom of Self-directed-learning
Self directed learning is really at the heart of what this program is all about. I really geek out about this because I have sort of been talking about this my whole life. A lot of people do; it is pretty evident to many people I've met in my life, in the US and outside of it, that schools provide students with so little autonomy and ownership over their own learning that they very much tend to teach things like obedience, rote memorization, acceptance of a lack of control, and the ability to either thrive within the limitations of a system of authoritarian control OR creative (and often self-destructive) exploration of how to escape a system of authoritarian control.

It's not always so dramatic - there are bright exceptions of freedom and creativity in all environments, and at least in my experience of the American Public school system I still have plenty of good experiences and still did learn a lot. But sometimes it was pretty dramatic. I mean, I was diagnosed with ADHD and medicated pretty heavily at a certain point (something I intend to write more about) and essentially I believe the moment I grew up is when I realized that there was nobody who could actually advocate for me but myself. The adults in my life saw my academic performance and decided the best solution was to drug me, and it was very necessary for me to reassess that and think critically about whether that was the best solution because I was experiencing really intense consequences of disassociation and lack of ability to really be myself.

I don't think this sort of acceptance of powerlessness happens to everyone. Some kids just have this fire in them. But I didn't really - I was told repeatedly that I needed to follow the rules and I think at a certain point, it's sad, but I didn't really believe in my ability to make decisions for myself anymore because over and over again my outlet to do so was revoked and over and over again I was punished for doing so and told that I should follow some other way of doing things bigger than myself. Like almost everyone, the parts of me that struggled with an existence like that are some of the most stubborn and opinionated parts of me today, forged in the hottest fires of experience I had; rebellion, distrust, and a feeling of betrayal.

Those are the feelings that, decades later, find a lot of Joy in recurse. Here is a place where adherence to one's OWN curiosities and interests is rewarded, and external direction is not given, not is it an encouraged resource. Without an expectation to be `productive` in the traditional sense, there is an unfurling of internal freedom that reminds of of kindergarten and summer camp and has been mostly absent in adult life. It's a special feeling of internal space.

I found I was so used to standards based on deliverables and productivity that, as I anticipated the start of this program, I tried to decide on what to rally my focus around. Something meaningful, of course. Something impressive probably, although I would admit to no one that clout mattered to me.

But on my first call before the program, my first contact with the culture of this place, I started to see the other way. The way where you may finish this program having finished *making*...nothing. Because that isn't the important way.

It was really hard for me to wrap my mind around this at first, a mind that was been mostly formed by decades of workforce and academic thinking, even by the expectations of the people around me for whom I want to provide not only economically but emotionally, for whom I want to be self critical as a means to an end; to protect them and to love them by being 'my best'.

But then it started to make sense as I was asked by others 'what are you planning on working on during recurse?' and I realized all of that pressure to make something useful, meaningful - it was
1) self imposed
2) not the only way forward.

There is a joy and a dignity in just learning. In just exploring. And seeing a culture based around that spirit has been refreshing in ways I really couldn't have imagined.
