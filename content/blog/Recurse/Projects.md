# 1) [[Blogging with Quartz| This Blog]]
*status: ✅ done!*

Didn't intend to make this when I was thinking of recurse projects, but three days in drowning in and struggling express so many ideas, it seemed crucial! I originally intended to build it from scratch with Next.js, but after some very good advice from my brother [Noah](https://noahlk.medium.com/)realized there were many, many easier ways. You're reading on it now, so project #1, done!

# 2) [[Eco Mog]]
*status: 💪🏼 In progress*

This could be a lot of things, but hopefully all of the following:
- An online multiplayer setup for multiple open worlds
- A persistent ecosystem that can be explored *on* those worlds and exists with our without player involvement

# 3 ) [[Gauntlet]]
*status: 💪🏼 In progress*

An input device that is worn as a glove and allows the user to output a different signal for every pad of their finger by pressing their thumb against it. This signal can be augmented with the angle of the hand, detected by an accelerometer/gyroscope sensor, and feedback to the user (like that a signal was created as desired) can be provided using small haptic feedback motors.
