I heard about this program through my brother a couple of years ago and wanted to do it ever since. What is it?

### This is what it's not:
1. A coding bootcamp
2. A job
3. A school...or at least not a traditional one

### Here's what it *is*:
- A self-directed learning environment
- A community of people who are interested in programming and learning
- A place where you can work on whatever you want
- An experience of 6 or 12 weeks in which each session overlaps with the next to create a continuous community of people helping each other and sharing what interests them not only in programming, but where the curious and rigorous ethos of coding touches gaming, mathematics, music, art and all sorts of other crazy things.

I'm in the Summer 1 batch of '24. As I write this, I'm on day three, and I'm so impressed by the program and the people here.
